	- RiboCalc model shows that a number of transcripts exhibited
	diverse coding ability among distinct cell types/states
	(CDCTs). We provided the detailed CDCT list at transcript level.

File2: CDCT_lincRNA_TransLnc_evidence_number.tab
	- A number of annotated lncRNAs were found to be associated
	with ribosomes experimentally[1-3] and encode functional
	peptides[4-6]. Consistently, we found independent experimental
	evidences of "lincRNAs CDCTs" based on TransLnc database[7]. We
	provided the number of translation evidences in TransLnc database
	of CDCTs that annotated as lincRNA by GENCODE.

File3: CDCT_cases.pdf
	- Canonical protein coding genes have been reported that protein
	expression ability could be varied or even silenced without
	altering mRNA transcribing[8-10]. There are also several
	experimentally validated cases of protein coding genes that
	are with translational silencing mediated by different cis-
	(intrinsic) or trans- (context) controls, including BRCA2[11],
	FGF13[12], PTGS2[13] and UCHL1[14]. The four cases are observed
	as CDCT and shows varied coding ability in different cells. The
	figure shows their Ribo-TPM in transcribed samples.
